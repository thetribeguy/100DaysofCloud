## Day 11 - Build Amazon VPC with Public and Private Subnets (from Scratch)


## Introduction

What is VPC?
VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. Itâ€™s a custom-defined virtual network within the AWS Cloud. Users can logically create their personal network, designing and implementing a separate and independent network that would operate in the AWS Cloud. Primary components are : Subnets, IP addresses, NAT Devices (Instances & Gateways), Route Tables, Internet & Virtual Private Gateways, Access Control Lists, Security groups, VPC Endpoints. A subnet is a segment of the VPC IP address range, where we can launch EC2 Instances, RDS, and other AWS resources.
