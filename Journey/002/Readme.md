Keep everything as default and click on Allocate button.


### Step 7 - Connect instance

Select your instance.

Click on Connect.

You will see 4 types of Connection methods. Choose EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH connection) and click on Connect.
Your Instance will be connected to SSH through your Browser.

Select the Elastic IP address created and click on Actions. Click on Associate Elastic IP address.

Choose your instance in the drop down below as shown below. 

Leave default values for the remaining fields and click on Associate.

### Step 8 - Try commands

Switch to root user: sudo -s

Run updates using the following command: 

yum -y update

To find your current working directory, enter the command pwd

Enter the exit command to go back to ec2-user then again exit to log out.

In this way, you can connect to your instance using SSH from your console without using a key pair.
